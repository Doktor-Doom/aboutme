    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>Greetings! My name is Krystian Francuz-Harris. You can call me Krys for short.</h2>
    <section> 
      <p>I am going to tell you a little bit about what makes me, <strong>ME</strong>; from my past <em>all</em> the way through to my future.</p>
      <p>I am the youngest of three children, who all grew up travelling the world via the Army's beck and will. Our mother, Leslie, raised us all on her own while serving. She inspired me to serve in the Army as well, and I successfully completed just under five years of service myself in 2017.</p>

      <h2><strong>Where I'm Headed</strong></h2>
      <p>Right now, I am headed to completion of the CodeFellows Software Development course. I am interested in learning about Cybersecurity as well. I am pretty new to the coding world, and want to focus on being a <em>sponge</em>. Once I get a better foundational knowledge about coding I am sure that I will be able to pinpoint where I want to begin my career. Until then, some of the things that interest me are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Gaming</li>
          <li>Cybersecurity</li>
          <li>Mobile Gaming</li>
          <li>Software Development</li>
          <li>Virtual Reality</li>
          <li>Robotics</li>
        </ul>
